\section{Introduction}

Into the Grid is a turn-based exploration and conquest game in which players connect to multiplayer universes, control a ship, and explore the various sectors of their universe.

\section{Problem Statement}
The current game market doesn't offer any turn-by-turn games that allow users to create and play on multiple modded universes.
Into the Grid will fill this gap in the market through its turn-by-turn format and use of user generated content.
